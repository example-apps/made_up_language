** Imagine a made-up language that: **
* doesn't allow literal values
* treats all function arguments as immutable
* only has five functions

			* loop(x) {...}				Loop(x) times and executes the intructions between {}
			* increment(x)				Returns the value of x + 1
			* assign(x, y)				Assign the value of y to x
			* zero()							Returns the number 0
			* return(x)						Exit current scope and return x to the caller

	** Implement the following functions: **

		- add(x, y)
		- multiply(x,y)
		- decrement(x)
		- subtract(x,y)
			  							extra credit
		- divide(x,y)
